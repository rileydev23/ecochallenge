## 1. Introduction
Reducing the carbon footprint is a crucial concern for young urban professionals. However, their busy lifestyles often make it challenging to adopt sustainable habits. To address this issue, we propose the development of a mobile application tailored to their needs, aiming to make sustainability practices accessible and engaging.

## 4. Solutions Scope

EcoChallenge is  designed to cater to the needs of busy young professionals, offering a user-friendly application that seamlessly integrates sustainable practices into their hectic lives. Recognizing their time constraints, the app presents small, actionable sustainability habits that require minimal effort and time commitment. Through its emphasis on community engagement, users are encouraged to share their sustainable habits and achievements, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and collective action. By empowering users to prioritize environmental consciousness within their social circles, EcoChallenge promotes sustainable living as a collaborative effort, making a meaningful impact on the environment while navigating the demands of modern life.

## 5. Benchmark

The benchmarking process for our EcoChallenge application is crucial for understanding the competitive landscape and user expectations in the sustainability domain. By evaluating similar products such as Ecohero and The Planet App, we can identify standout features and functionalities that can inspire and enhance our own application.

Upon careful analysis of the evaluated products, we can recognize aspects that we should leverage in EcoChallenge, such as the ability to use the app without the need to log in, the creation of posts with specific themes, and an achievement system to track user progress. Additionally, we observe the importance of including a login system with Google accounts, as well as an achievement system based on themes and challenges, along with a weekly leaderboard based on a points system.

Furthermore, benchmarking allows us to identify areas for improvement and opportunities to optimize EcoChallenge. For example, we noticed a lack of diversity in posts and the need to eliminate redundant features, such as a calendar that does not align with the application and adds no value. We also recognize the importance of reducing image loading times for posts and enhancing the user experience by introducing a dark mode and removing the requirement for mandatory profile pictures.
