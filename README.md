## 1. Introduction
Reducing the carbon footprint has become increasingly urgent as global temperatures surpass historical levels, with the Earth currently 1.1°C warmer than in the 19th century. Despite international agreements like the Paris Accord aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C, current trends suggest we are not on track to meet this target. This poses severe consequences for climate stability and ecosystems worldwide. (United Nations, 2023)

For young urban professionals, balancing hectic work schedules and responsibilities often hinders their ability to adopt sustainable practices such as recycling or using public transport. Their interest in addressing climate change is evident, yet the constraints of their lifestyles present a significant barrier.

To bridge this gap, there is a compelling need for innovative solutions tailored to their circumstances. One promising approach involves the development of a mobile application designed to integrate sustainable habits seamlessly into their daily lives. By gamifying sustainable actions and offering practical tips, this app aims to empower young professionals to make impactful environmental choices despite their time constraints.

By leveraging technology to align environmental stewardship with their busy lifestyles, we can foster a generation committed to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

## 3. Strategy
Our project aligns with the Strategy plane of the Elements of User Experience framework by focusing on meeting both the business and user objectives. Using a Value Proposition Canvas, we aim to identify and address the needs of our target audience effectively.

## 4. Solutions Scope

EcoChallenge is  designed to cater to the needs of busy young professionals, offering a user-friendly application that seamlessly integrates sustainable practices into their hectic lives. Recognizing their time constraints, the app presents small, actionable sustainability habits that require minimal effort and time commitment. Through its emphasis on community engagement, users are encouraged to share their sustainable habits and achievements, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and collective action. By empowering users to prioritize environmental consciousness within their social circles, EcoChallenge promotes sustainable living as a collaborative effort, making a meaningful impact on the environment while navigating the demands of modern life.

## 5. Benchmark

The benchmarking process for our EcoChallenge application is crucial for understanding the competitive landscape and user expectations in the sustainability domain. By evaluating similar products such as Ecohero and The Planet App, we can identify standout features and functionalities that can inspire and enhance our own application.

Upon careful analysis of the evaluated products, we can recognize aspects that we should leverage in EcoChallenge, such as the ability to use the app without the need to log in, the creation of posts with specific themes, and an achievement system to track user progress. Additionally, we observe the importance of including a login system with Google accounts, as well as an achievement system based on themes and challenges, along with a weekly leaderboard based on a points system.

Furthermore, benchmarking allows us to identify areas for improvement and opportunities to optimize EcoChallenge. For example, we noticed a lack of diversity in posts and the need to eliminate redundant features, such as a calendar that does not align with the application and adds no value. We also recognize the importance of reducing image loading times for posts and enhancing the user experience by introducing a dark mode and removing the requirement for mandatory profile pictures.

## 6. Customer Journey Map
The Customer Journey Map is an essential tool for comprehending the user experience with our product or service. By meticulously charting each stage, from initial contact to ongoing interactions, we can pinpoint emotions, needs, and key moments. This analysis reveals challenges and opportunities to enhance the experience and craft exceptional solutions. Immersing ourselves in the user's perspective allows us to create memorable experiences and deepen our relationship with them.

## 8. Wireframes

The wireframe is a document that illustrates the overall vision of the project through the precise composition of various navigation components. It serves as a template for construction, facilitating the transmission of the complexity of the outcome. This initial step is crucial to confirm whether the product will meet expectations.
